QUICKSTART:

  CGI:

  1. make get-cgic
  2. make cgi
  3. copy jsonptunnel.cgi to your cgi-bin (or equivalent).

  FastCGI:

  1. make get-cgic
  2. make fcgi
  3. Configure your web server to run jsonptunnel.fcgi. See "LIGHTTPD.EXAMPLE.CONF"
     for an example configuration.

  CAVEATS:

  You may have to modify the variable FCGI_INCLUDE at the top of the
  Makefile to point to the location of the FastCGI header files
  on your system.

  To switch between fcgi and cgi builds, 'make clean'
  before running 'make cgi' or 'make fcgi.'
