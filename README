QUICKSTART:

  1. make get-cgic
  2. make
  3. copy the created jsonptunnel.cgi to your cgi-bin (or equivalent).

REQUIREMENTS:

  1. libcurl
  2. libcgic - download automatically with 'make get-cgic' command.

  jsonptunnel requires libcurl and libcgic.  libcurl is pretty common,
  libcgic is not.  the 'make get-cgic' command downloads cgic into the
  current directory and a subsequent make command will build the library
  and link against it.

ABOUT:

  This is a C CGI program that takes two required parameters
  as an HTTP "GET":

  jsonptunnel.cgi?extURL=http://somewhere.com/app/post&extMethod=POST&arg1=
  lol&arg2=rofl...

  The program then POSTS all passed variables other than extURL, extMethod, and extCallback
  to the specified URL.  Returned data is printed,
  and the callback method is appended to the output.
