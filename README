ABOUT:

  This is a C cgi that "mirrors" web services available via HTTP POST
  or GET.  The reason you might want to do this is to access off-site
  JSON data sources from scripts via JSONP.

  Because the trick behind JSONP is dynamically adding "<script>" nodes
  to the DOM with the DOM API, it's intrinsically limited to external
  scripts available with an HTTP "GET."

  This CGI lets you send HTTP POST data to off-site URLs, and
  retrieve the result, with an HTTP GET - it 'tunnels' GET 
  to POST.

OVERVIEW:

  jsonptunnel.cgi itself looks for four GET variables, two of which 
  are required:

    REQUIRED:

      1. extURL - the URL to GET or POST to.
      2. extMethod - the HTTP method to use when fetching the URL.

    OPTIONAL:

      1. extCallback - wraps the off-site output with a function
                       named this parameter, taking the returned
                       data as its only parameter.  Many JSONP
                       web services provide their own 'callback'
                       parameter; if they don't, you can use this.


      NOT IMPLEMENTED:

        2. extCache - if this is set to anything, look for
                      a cached version of the query before
                      fetching.  This feature is not yet implemented.

    EXAMPLE:
      
      http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/jsonptunnel.cgi?extURL=http://
      somewhereelse.com/data/post&extMethod=POST&someThing=yo&
      somethingElse=rofl

    EXPLANATION:

      jsonptunnel sends any variables you specify in the query
      string other than the ext* variables to the target URL.

    LIVE EXAMPLE:

      http://ubergibson.com/~alan/calc/

      This is a page using Mootools with the JsonP extension from clientcide.
      It's an example of how to tunnel a POST request across domains to a
      simple web service that adds two numbers, and display the result.

QUICKSTART:

  1. make get-cgic
  2. make
  3. copy the created jsonptunnel.cgi to your cgi-bin (or equivalent).

DEPENDENCIES:

  1. libcurl
  2. libcgic - download automatically with 'make get-cgic' command.

  jsonptunnel requires libcurl and libcgic.  libcurl is pretty common,
  libcgic is not.  The 'make get-cgic' command downloads cgic into the
  current directory and a subsequent make command will build the library
  and link against it.
