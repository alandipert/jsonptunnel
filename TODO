Support more HTTP verbs:
  PUT, DELETE.

Ideally all REST verbs would be possible with jsonptunnel.  This
is just a matter of adding more functions to fetch.c and modifiying
request.c to handle different "extMethods."  The old branches show
how it used to work when GET was also supported.

Look into SCGI.
